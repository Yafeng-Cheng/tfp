# Tensorflow probability
This is to learn to use tensorflow probabilty with different examples. The tensorflow probability is a great project to bridge machine learning and Bayesian statistics. The model of interest at the moment is:
 * Mixed effect models
 * Gaussian process
 * Mixture models
 * Bayesian neural network
 * Variational autoencoder
